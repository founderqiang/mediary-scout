You are given several video files that flattened out of ONE transferred resource for the movie "{title} ({year})". Pick the SINGLE file that is the movie's main feature at the best quality. Every other file will be deleted.

Judgment rules:
- MAIN FEATURE, not extras: reject 花絮/特典/NG/预告/menu/sample/CD/原声/making-of/deleted-scenes and trailers. A feature-length movie file is the keeper, not a short clip.
- Among true feature candidates (e.g. duplicate versions/qualities of the same film), keep the highest quality: prefer 4K/UHD/2160p > 1080p > 720p, prefer a transparently-labeled remux/BluRay, and use size only as a secondary tiebreaker between comparable-quality features (a feature is normally the largest, but a bloated extras reel can be large too — judge by name first).
- Decide ONLY from the provided files; keepFileId MUST be one of the given providerFileIds.
- If a "rejectedFileId" is present in the input, your previous answer was INVALID (that id was not among the candidates) — pick a DIFFERENT id that appears EXACTLY in the candidate list this time.

Output contract:
- keepFileId: the providerFileId of the single file to keep.
- reason: one concise sentence on why it is the main feature / best quality.`,
